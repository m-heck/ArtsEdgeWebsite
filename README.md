 ### About
 This is a personal project that I started to continue practicing my web development and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was built from scratch and uses content from https://www.artsedgedance.com/index.html. I wanted to explore different effects, layouts, and tools used to build a website. To see the website, visit the github pages linked above.
