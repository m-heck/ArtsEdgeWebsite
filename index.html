        <p class="fade-in">At Arts Edge, our goal is to provide the highest quality dance training, adhering to a curriculum in a way that builds formation of character so that each student grows, not only physically as a dancer, but strives for standards of excellence that are applicable to all areas of life. </p>
        <p class="fade-in">In 2010 we started with a dream. </p>
        <p class="fade-in">A dream of creating an arts education facility that provided the very best performing arts education in a warm family environment.  With the support of The Florida Ballet we assembled the very best teaching staff in the area.  Those who not only have a deep love for their art form, but a vested interest in the success of your children. </p>
        <p class="fade-in">We feel so blessed to be surrounded by such amazing, supportive people, from the parent's who entrust us with their child's dance education, to our amazing faculty and above all the incredible children that dance at Arts Edge.  As we continue to grow, we will never forget our mission and why our school was created.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">To each and every smiling face and pair of dancing feet, never let that sparkle in each of you fade.  Work hard and dream big!</p>

        <h2 class="fade-in"><a href="#classes-text" id="classes-text" class="body-self-links">Classes & Policies</a></h2>
        <div class="class-element">
            <h3>Class Descriptions:</h3>
            <p>There are many factors that can determine which age groups and levels are best for a child - personality, natural ability, and experience broadly describe some of them.  Students thrive in widely differing situations.  We encourage you to trust the instructor's recommendation and allow your child's skills to unfold at a natural pace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element">
            <h3>Dress Code & Studio Policies</h3>
            <p>It is important to follow the required dress code so that the instructors can teach efficiently.  A uniform look allows the instructor to quickly and easily see the students' movements and not be distracted by loud colors and patterns. The dress code allows the instructor to make accurate and appropriate corrections. We also ask that all students wear a cover-up in and out of the studio for their safety from unwanted attention from outside sources. Hair for ballet classes is always in a bun on the crown of their head.  Hair in other dance classes should be pulled back in a ponytail and all hair should be away from the face. A cloth headband is great to hold bangs or short hair. ONLY stud earrings are allowed, NO other jewelry. These things will contribute to getting the most out of class.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element">
            <h3>Pre-Primary (3-5 years old) & Pre-Primary B (4.5-5 years old)</h3>
            <p>This 45 minute class is designed to expand on the natural joy of movement and creativity for three to five-year-old students.  After basic warm-ups, isolations and stretches, the students practice steps across the floor and in patterns.  Special lessons and class themes are designed to build imagination and expressiveness in the students' movement. Rhythm and music skills are taught through specific exercises.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Girls:</b> Pale Pink leotard, pink tights (no underpants should be worn under tights) and pink ballet shoes in leather or canvas. PLEASE, NO SKIRTS. Hair should be in a bun.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Boys:</b> White T-shirt, black sweatpants or long shorts and black ballet shoes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element">
            <h3>Primary Ballet (5.5-7 years old)</h3>
            <p>This class offers young students the opportunity to explore more than one dance form. Classwork consists of more complex and detailed movement than in previous classes, while still allowing time for fun, creative exercises.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code:</b> Same as pre-primary A & B.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element">
            <h3>Level Information</h3>
            <p>Students move through the levels offered in the order listed below.  This depends on such things as natural ability, learning style, focus and attendance. Students may move through the syllabus at differing rates. Not all levels are offered in all styles of dance. Please speak to your instructor if you have questions about the appropriate level</p>
            <p><b>Level I:</b> Beginner (1-2 yrs)</p>
            <p><b>Level II:</b> Advanced Beginner (2-3 yrs)</p>
            <p><b>Level III:</b> (3-4 yrs)</p>
            <p><b>Level IV:</b> Advanced</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element">
            <h3>Classical Ballet (Ages 7 & up)</h3>
            <p>This centuries-old dance form is known for its grace and beauty which requires tremendous discipline, strength and flexibility. Based on clearly defined positions of the body, training requires patience and repetition for many years to acquire the strength and refinement necessary to master this beautiful art form. It is required that students taking ballet at this level be enrolled in two ballet classes per week. Students wishing to work on pointe, are required to take three classes per week.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Girls:</b> Black leotard, pink tights, pink ballet shoes, hair in a bun on the crown of their head and hair away from their face.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Boys:</b> White T-shirt, black sweatpants, tights (with dance belt) and black ballet shoes.</p>
