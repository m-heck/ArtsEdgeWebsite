        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Class Descriptions:</h3>
            <p>There are many factors that can determine which age groups and levels are best for a child - personality, natural ability, and experience broadly describe some of them.  Students thrive in widely differing situations.  We encourage you to trust the instructor's recommendation and allow your child's skills to unfold at a natural pace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Dress Code & Studio Policies</h3>
            <p>It is important to follow the required dress code so that the instructors can teach efficiently.  A uniform look allows the instructor to quickly and easily see the students' movements and not be distracted by loud colors and patterns. The dress code allows the instructor to make accurate and appropriate corrections. We also ask that all students wear a cover-up in and out of the studio for their safety from unwanted attention from outside sources. Hair for ballet classes is always in a bun on the crown of their head.  Hair in other dance classes should be pulled back in a ponytail and all hair should be away from the face. A cloth headband is great to hold bangs or short hair. ONLY stud earrings are allowed, NO other jewelry. These things will contribute to getting the most out of class.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Pre-Primary (3-5 years old) & Pre-Primary B (4.5-5 years old)</h3>
            <p>This 45 minute class is designed to expand on the natural joy of movement and creativity for three to five-year-old students.  After basic warm-ups, isolations and stretches, the students practice steps across the floor and in patterns.  Special lessons and class themes are designed to build imagination and expressiveness in the students' movement. Rhythm and music skills are taught through specific exercises.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Girls:</b> Pale Pink leotard, pink tights (no underpants should be worn under tights) and pink ballet shoes in leather or canvas. PLEASE, NO SKIRTS. Hair should be in a bun.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Boys:</b> White T-shirt, black sweatpants or long shorts and black ballet shoes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Primary Ballet (5.5-7 years old)</h3>
            <p>This class offers young students the opportunity to explore more than one dance form. Classwork consists of more complex and detailed movement than in previous classes, while still allowing time for fun, creative exercises.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code:</b> Same as pre-primary A & B.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Level Information</h3>
            <p>Students move through the levels offered in the order listed below.  This depends on such things as natural ability, learning style, focus and attendance. Students may move through the syllabus at differing rates. Not all levels are offered in all styles of dance. Please speak to your instructor if you have questions about the appropriate level</p>
            <p><b>Level I:</b> Beginner (1-2 yrs)</p>
            <p><b>Level II:</b> Advanced Beginner (2-3 yrs)</p>

        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Classical Ballet (Ages 7 & Up)</h3>
            <p>This centuries-old dance form is known for its grace and beauty which requires tremendous discipline, strength and flexibility. Based on clearly defined positions of the body, training requires patience and repetition for many years to acquire the strength and refinement necessary to master this beautiful art form. It is required that students taking ballet at this level be enrolled in two ballet classes per week. Students wishing to work on pointe, are required to take three classes per week.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Girls:</b> Black leotard, pink tights, pink ballet shoes, hair in a bun on the crown of their head and hair away from their face.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Boys:</b> White T-shirt, black sweatpants, tights (with dance belt) and black ballet shoes.</p>
        </div>

            <p>Pointe work is an essential part of upper-level ballet training. Classes are offered by teacher recommendation only and three ballet classes are required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Contemporary (Ages 11 & Up)</h3>
            <p>In order to take this class, you have to take a ballet or modern class as well (exceptions made for High School Juniors and Seniors with the approval of the teacher). This class focuses on creative self-expression, breaking rigid constraints of classical ballet and stretching beyond traditional modern dance techniques. The class is challenging with an emphasis on expression and exploring new movement. The students will have to go deeper into the quality of movement in order to change their usual and stereotyped gestures into a more personal way of moving.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code:</b> No shoes, black leotard, convertible pink, black or caramel. Stirrup tights, jazz pants or capris over Leo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Hip Hop (Ages 7 & Up)</h3>
            <p>Hip Hop is a high energy street dance that evolved in urban areas across the country over the past 30 years. Class includes a warm-up, development of hip hop movements, vocabulary and a combination that are tailored for the dancer's respective ages.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code:</b> Leotard-no color restriction, black, pink or Caramel tights.  You can wear a tank or t-shirt over a leotard, jazz pants or capris.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Jass (Ages 7 & Up)</h3>
            <p>Jazz classes expose students to many forms that make up this diverse genre of dance. Students will study classic jazz technique, musical theater, lyrical jazz, contemporary/modern jazz movement and hip hop influenced styles. Jazz classes consist of warm-up center work and traveling progressions. These are all designed to increase flexibility, strength, and technique. Classes will also include learning pieces of choreography and developing performance, confidence and expression.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code:</b> Black leotard and black, pink or Caramel tights. Jazz pants or capris can be worn over Leo. Tan jazz shoes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-elemet fade-in">
            <h3>Modern (Ages 7 & Up)</h3>
            <p>The emphasis of this class is on performing the modern dance techniques of Lester Horton, Jose Limon, and Martha Graham. Modern dance principles include centering, alignment, gravity, breath, contraction, release, fall and recovery, suspension, floor work, balance and off-balance, tension and relaxation. This class will also explore improvisational techniques and partnering.  The concurrent study of ballet is highly recommended to develop clarity of the body lines and strength.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code:</b> No shoes, black leotard, convertible pink, black or Caramel tight or stirrups. Jazz pants or capris over Leo.</p>
