        <h2 class="fade-in"><a href="#classes-text" id="classes-text" class="body-self-links">Classes & Policies</a></h2>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Class Descriptions:</h3>
            <p>There are many factors that can determine which age groups and levels are best for a child - personality, natural ability, and experience broadly describe some of them.  Students thrive in widely differing situations.  We encourage you to trust the instructor's recommendation and allow your child's skills to unfold at a natural pace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Dress Code & Studio Policies</h3>
            <p>It is important to follow the required dress code so that the instructors can teach efficiently.  A uniform look allows the instructor to quickly and easily see the students' movements and not be distracted by loud colors and patterns. The dress code allows the instructor to make accurate and appropriate corrections. We also ask that all students wear a cover-up in and out of the studio for their safety from unwanted attention from outside sources. Hair for ballet classes is always in a bun on the crown of their head.  Hair in other dance classes should be pulled back in a ponytail and all hair should be away from the face. A cloth headband is great to hold bangs or short hair. ONLY stud earrings are allowed, NO other jewelry. These things will contribute to getting the most out of class.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class-element fade-in">
            <h3>Pre-Primary (3-5 years old) & Pre-Primary B (4.5-5 years old)</h3>
            <p>This 45 minute class is designed to expand on the natural joy of movement and creativity for three to five-year-old students.  After basic warm-ups, isolations and stretches, the students practice steps across the floor and in patterns.  Special lessons and class themes are designed to build imagination and expressiveness in the students' movement. Rhythm and music skills are taught through specific exercises.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Girls:</b> Pale Pink leotard, pink tights (no underpants should be worn under tights) and pink ballet shoes in leather or canvas. PLEASE, NO SKIRTS. Hair should be in a bun.</p>
            <p><b>Dress Code for Boys:</b> White T-shirt, black sweatpants or long shorts and black ballet shoes.</p>

            <p><b>Dress Code for Girls:</b> Black leotard, pink tights, pink ballet shoes, hair in a bun on the crown of their head and hair away from their face.</p>

This class focuses on creative self-expression, breaking rigid constraints of classical ballet and stretching beyond traditional modern dance techniques. The class is challenging with an emphasis on expression and exploring new movement.
